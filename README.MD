# Build

## PCBs (2023-06-21):
I used piotr_go's gerber files from [https://github.com/piotr-go/DIY-A586/blob/master/v1.9/pcb/v1.9/gerbers.tar.gz](https://github.com/piotr-go/DIY-A586/blob/master/v1.9/pcb/v1.9/gerbers.tar.gz) as a source. Repacked as a zip and ordered boards from JLCPCB.

Following parameters were used:

- Layers: 2

- Board Outline Tolerance: Â±0.2mm (Regular)

1. Why ENIG for a prototype boards designs: 
- because it was not much more expensive than a regular board

## Parts ordered (2023-06-24)
To acquire all the necessary components for the DIY-A586-v1.9 board, I made the following purchases:

1. **Bulk Order from LCSC:**
    - I placed a bulk order from LCSC, a reliable electronics components supplier, to obtain the majority of the required parts. I exported BOM file from LCSD to [LCSC_Exported__20230624_151154.csv](LCSC_Exported__20230624_151154.csv). This file contains most of the components needed. As a precautionary measure I ordered additional components and BOM should allow to assemble 3 boards. 

2. **1N4148 Diodes from eBay:**
    - I purchased the 1N4148 diodes from eBay using the following link: [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/115574778107](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/115574778107).

3. **PS2 Ports from AliExpress:**
    - To acquire the necessary PS2 ports, I placed an order through AliExpress using the provided link: [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005368783447.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005368783447.html) for **L 6Pin Straight Feet** and **K 6Pin Green**

4. **Tactile Switches from AliExpress:**
    - Lastly, I obtained the required tactile switches by making a purchase from AliExpress. I followed the link: [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005274168459.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005274168459.html) for **Type 3, 6x6x5mm switches**.
    
## Soldering equipment (2023-06-24):

To ensure a smooth soldering process, it is recommended to have the following tools and materials readily available:

- **Soldering Iron:** An inexpensive soldering iron can (hopefully?) be used for the task. You can find suitable options at [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005368783447.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005368783447.html).

- **Soldering Tips:** It is advisable to have a variety of soldering tips and accessories on hand. I will be using [https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003390702660.html](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003390702660.html).

- **Soldering Wire:** For optimal results, I will use **WELLER Solder ROSIN CORE FLEX Wire WSWSACLO Sn3.0AG05CU 0.5mm 50gr LeadFree RoHS**.

- **PCB Circuit Board Holder:** To simplify the soldering process and ensure stability, I will utilise a PCB circuit board holder from [https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/155581423064](https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/155581423064).

- **Flux:** Soldering wire has flux core, so hopefully additional flux will not be needed but if required I will be using RELIFE RL-422.
